# Personal Photography Portfolio
I try to keep myself busy. And Photography is a big hobby and passion of mine. So here I want to create a website, perhaps it'll evovlve into a template, so I can display all my work. 

This shall be the beginning of a static Portfolio page. 

## Finished 

none

## Planning

General Layout should be thought about and inserted. But perhaps I need to know which Pages I'll first need.

Pages Involved: 

* Home Page
* About Me 
* Gallery
* Testimonials
* Pricing
* Impressum 

Features Needed: 

* Contact Form 
* Social Media Link


Home Page
===

Have a nice page for people to land on and explore and grab their attention. Have a Splash screen with an image of me looking approachable but proffesional. Have Info "below the fold" already show to show them that there is more information below.
Simple Call to Actions but definitely low key, I don't want to be an ass about the business side. I should be an inviting portfolio after all. 

Next should be Sections containing all of the other Pages in Summary so the user/visitor can go the page and seek the information they need about me. 

About Me
===

This Page should highlight my Personality. Focus on Story Telling, but keep it organized in a way that people can quickly skim over the page. 

### Things to Highlight:
* My Need to learn new things. 
* My Creative side
* My looming passion for Photography
* Why I like Photography and want to capture Images of other people. 
* (Definitely think of more unique aspects)

Other than that. Show that I am a person and not just a Photographer. I like doing so many things. 
Highlight things about by Law Studies, My Proffesion of Nursing and my aptitude towards tech and my current journey with web development.
